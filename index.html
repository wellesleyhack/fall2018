There was constant energy flowing in the room!"</p>

Being surrounded by other women who share the same passion about tech was incredibly inspiring, and I learned so much about how to work productively with others collectively towards a goal. Having extremely active, accessible, and supportive mentors also made my experience that much more rewarding."</p>

							<ul class="text-large">
								<li >What is a hackathon?
                  <p>It’s a grand gathering of people to make their ideas come to life. Think out of the box, try new technologies, ask questions, make mistakes, discover a new language, and have fun! We will be following Major League Hacking's <a target="_blank" href="https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf" alt="code of conduct">Code of Conduct.</a> Check out their video explaining what a hackathon is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj4DQfYx2Hg" alt="What is a hackathon?">here</a>.</p>
                </li>
								<li>What if I have no experience with coding or hackathons?
                	<p>Don’t sweat it! We’ve purposefully designed WHACK to offer an encouraging and supportive environment. At WHACK, you’ll quickly learn from our workshops and army of mentors, as well as your team members and other students.</p>
								</li>
								<li>When is the deadline to apply?
									<p>The deadline to apply is the midnight of October 15, 2017, and decisions will be sent out in the following weeks.</p>
								</li>
								<li>Who can attend? Is this event only for women?
                	<p>We welcome any undergraduate college student 18+ to participate in WHACK. It’s important to keep in mind that we are looking to create a welcoming and empowering space for women and other underrepresented identities in tech. If you have any questions about this, please contact us!</p>
								</li>
								<li>Will travel costs be reimbursed?
                  <p>We will be organizing Lyft rides for students who attend schools in the greater Boston area.

										We will be also sending three buses to schools throughout the Northeast. (If your school is located near one of these schools, you’re welcome to join to join the bus rides!)
										<br><br>Bus 1 (Pennsylvania): Bryn Mawr College, University of Pennsylania.
										<br>Bus 2 (New York): NYU, Barnard College/Columbia University, Fordham Univeristy.
										<br>Bus 3 (Massachusetts): UMass Amherst, Smith College, Mount Holyoke College.

										<br><br>Unfortunately, at this time, we are unable to reimburse for flights. Once you’ve accepted your spot at WHACK, we’ll provide more details about transportation.</p>
								</li>
								<li>How will mentorship work?
                	<p>We believe that mentorship is essential to an effective learning experience. You will have access to wonderful mentors throughout the entire event who will help guide you and help you troubleshoot, including industry professionals, Wellesley College alums, faculty, and experienced hackers.</p>
								</li>
                <li>How will teams work?
                	<p>Each team may have between 2-4 people. You and your friend may apply as a team, but everyone must submit individual applications. Members of teams who apply together will all receive the same acceptance decision.<br><br>We’ll also be facilitating team-formation activities before and during the event to help you find teams. Although you’re welcome to hack on your own, only teams are eligible to win prizes.</p>
								</li>
								<li>How will hackers be accepted?
									<p>We accept hackers based on a holistic approach that takes into account your experience level, enthusiasm, qualities you would bring to the hackathon, geographical location (and if we're reasonably able to support your travel financially), and other aspects of your application in order to curate a diverse hacker pool. Members of teams who apply together will all receive the same acceptance decision.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>What will I eat?
									<p>Trust us, you won’t be hungry at WHACK! We’ll provide Friday night dinner, all meals on Saturday, and Sunday breakfast & lunch. We’ll also have a snack table, food surprises, and coffee throughout the hackathon. We work hard to accommodate all dietary restrictions and make healthy options available.</p>
								</li>
								<li>Where will I sleep?
                	<p>We will provide quiet sleeping areas at night, equipped with blankets and pillows. Bringing your own sleeping bag and eye mask is encouraged!</p>
								</li>
								<li>Will there be showers?
                	<p>Yes!! Showers will be available throughout the event, courtesy of the Wellesley Keohane Sports Center. However, hackers are required to bring their own towels.</p>
								</li>
								<li>What should I bring to the hackathon?
									<p>Please bring your student ID (and government ID highly encouraged), laptop, and chargers. We also recommend that you bring some warm clothing, a blanket, towel, toiletries, and anything else you might need in order to spend the night. </p>
								</li>
								<li>What if I can only come for part of the weekend?
									<p>If you have a special circumstance, please stipulate it on your application. WHACK is ultimately a resource for you to learn, connect with others, and meet mentors in industry, so you'll get more out of it if you can stay for the whole event.</p>
								</li>
                <li>Who do I contact with other questions?
                	<p>Shoot us a message at <a href="mailto:hello@wellesleyhacks.org?subject=Questions%20about%20WHACK!"> hello@wellesleyhacks.org</a> or tweet at us<a href="https://twitter.com/wellesleyhack">@wellesleyhack</a> and we’ll get right back to you!</p>
