                  <p class="text-stories">
                    Last year, Lisa van Gelder was interviewing for a new executive job in NYC at the same time as two (white, male) friends. Because they had a similar amount of experience and similar interests, they ended up interviewing at the same companies at the same time, and Lisa found herself in an unintentional A/B test. When they compared notes, she found that she had a radically different interview experience than her friends. Lisa discusses what she learned from her accidental A/B tests, how the term “unqualified” is often used to reject marginalised groups in tech, and what we can do about it, as interviewees looking for a new job and as allies.
                  <p class="speaker-subtitle">About Lisa: </p>
                  <p class="text-stories">
                    Lisa has been working in software for over 17 years now, since she started building websites in 1999 and found backend problems were way more fun.  She is currently VP of Engineering at Meetup. Lisa is also a board member of Write/Speak/Code, a non profit whose mission is to level up women and nonbinary software developers through blogging, public speaking and open source software. She is mostly powered by coffee.
